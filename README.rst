An interpreter framework

Overview
============

**kmd** allows to build command line driven shells
with powerful tab-completion capabilities.

The kmd.Kmd class derives from `cmd.Cmd`_ and extends it in the
following ways:

1. Instead of Python's readline_ module, kmd.Kmd uses the alternative
   rl_ readline bindings.

2. Setup and tear-down of the readline completer have been moved to *preloop*
   and *postloop* respectively. Subclasses must make sure to call their
   parents' implementations.

3. Incomplete command names are automatically expanded if they are unique.

4. Command aliases can be defined by extending the *aliases* dictionary.
   Alias names apply to all *do_*, *complete_*, and *help_* attributes.

5. Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments. The new *comment* method
   is invoked, receiving the line as argument.

6. It is now possible to configure the *shell_escape_chars*.
   The default is '!'.

7. If a *history_file* is set, kmd.Kmd loads and saves the history
   in *preloop* and *postloop*.

8. The new *run* method encapsulates the full execution cycle of a Kmd.
